This Mod is BAD
This is my first public mod, made in MCreator – and yes, it's chaotic.

Adds:

Several overpowered bosses
Totally broken armor sets
New items, blocks, effects
And a new dimension called "Wymiar Haosu" (Chaos Dimension)
🧟 Bosses:
Springi Koper
Koper Dino
Eternal Koper King
Leviatan Haosu
Xaltorgath’s Core
⚠️ Balanced? Not really. But it’s fun as hell.

💬 Info from the Developer
I’m from Poland 🇵🇱 and I will translate all non translated mod content into English soon – stay tuned!
For now, some names or texts may still be in Polish.

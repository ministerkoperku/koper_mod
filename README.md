# This Mod is BAD

This is my **first public mod**, made in MCreator – and yes, it's chaotic.

## 🔥 Adds:
- Several **overpowered bosses**
- Totally broken **armor sets**
- New items, blocks, effects
- A new dimension called **"Wymiar Haosu"** (Chaos Dimension)

## 👹 Bosses:
- Springi Koper
- Koper Dino
- Eternal Koper King
- Leviatan Haosu
- Xaltorgath’s Core

⚠️ **Balanced?** Not really. But it's fun as hell.

## 💬 Info from the Developer
I'm from Poland 🇵🇱 and I will **translate all non-translated mod content into English** soon – stay tuned!  
For now, some names or texts may still be in Polish.
